# Project3
//Emissions Data Visualization
The goal of this project is to tell a story using data visualizations.
Interactivity should be built-in, allowing users to explore data on their own.
Teams will also create a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data wrangling techniques, and final visualization

//Five Project Requirements

1. Data and data delivery
Emissions by type and country
Kaggle, data.gov, etc
https://zenodo.org/record/7215364#.ZDSrF3bMJD9

2. Back end (ETL)
python
pandas
MongoDB -- this might be a data drvien, sql/sqlite might be better if data is not a JSON

Your visualization must include a python **Flask-powered API**, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and at leat one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)
reference: Week 10 > Day 3 > Activity 4

Fall into one of the below four tracks:
a combination of web scrpaing and Leftlet of Plotly; Plotly, but going to try Leaflet
a dashboard page with mulitple charts that update from the same data

Include at least one JS library that we did not cover 
reference: [[chartsjs.org/docs.latest/]] or [[popper.js.org/]]

Powered by a dataset with at least 1000+ records -- Confirmed

3. Visualizations
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as menus, dropdowns, & textboxes 
-- covered with popper

Final Visualzation must have 3 views; or try to. 
Leaflet -- By country [heatmap; fire hydrant exercise]
Leaflet -- By layer each type of emissions
Leaflet -- Future thinking with r value; liner regression - data might not be linear, not required. 

Plotly -- Bar by By country
Plotly -- Bubble by ___
Plotly -- third example

4. Group presentations
-- 

5. Slide deck

//Comments 
plotyly and leftlet might not go together
