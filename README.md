# Project3


The goal of this project is to tell a story using data visualizations.
Interactivity should be built-in, allowing users to explore data on their own.
Teams will also create a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data wrangling techniques, and final visualization

// Five Project Requirements

-- Emissions by type and country

Back end (ETL)

//Emissions Data Visualization
Your visualization must include a python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and at leat one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)
reference: Week 10 > Day 3 > Activity 4

You Project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
-- a combination of web scrpaing and Leftlet of Plotly; Plotly, but going to try Leaflet
-- a dashboard page iwth mulitple charts that update from the same data

Your project shoudl inclue at leas one JS library that we did not cover 
reference: [[chartsjs.org/docs.latest/]] or [[popper.js.org/]]

Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
 -- Yes, link to websites used

Your poject must include some level of user-drivn interaction, such as menus, dropdowns, & textboxes 
-- covered with popper

Final Visualzation must have 3 views; or try to. 
Leaflet -- By country
Leaflet -- By layer each type of emissions
Leaflet -- Future thinking with r value.

Plotly -- Bar by By country
Plotly -- Bubble by ___
Plotly -- third example
