## Emissions Data Visualization
The goal of this project is to tell a story using data visualizations.
Interactivity should be built-in, allowing users to explore data on their own.
Teams will also create a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data wrangling techniques, and final visualization

# Five Project Requirements

1. Data and data delivery
Emissions by type and country
We researched dataset on the following sites:

   * Kaggle, data.gov, etc

   * We used the following dataset:

   * [Emissions data set](https://zenodo.org/record/7215364#.ZDSrF3bMJD9)

2. Back end (ETL)

   - python

   - pandas

   - postgresql

     * Your visualization must include a python **Flask-powered API**, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)


      * Fall into one of the below four tracks:
          - a combination of web scraping and Leaftlet of Plotly; 
          - a dashboard page with mulitple charts that update from the same data

       * Include at least one JS library that we did not cover 
          - reference: [Charts.js](chartsjs.org/docs.latest/) 

       * Powered by a dataset with at least 1000+ records

3. Visualizations
  * Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as menus, dropdowns & textboxes 


   * Final Visualzation must have 3 views: 

      * Plotly -- Bar by By country

      * Plotly -- Pie chart by country

      * Charts.js -- multi line graph 

4. Group presentations
